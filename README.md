[It's here](Assets/ProjectileSystem/)  
  
The intent was to create plausible, physicaly accurate way of representing things that can be thrown, explode and deal damage.  
  
  
+ Raycast-based calculations allow to imitate ricochet, scale impact force by impact angle and avoid clipping.

+ Adjustable air resistance to drag projectiles depending on mass.  
<img height="200" src="/docs/img/aerodynamics.gif">  
  
+ Settings for visual effects including color, light and emission.

+ Interaction with hittable targets realized through target interface.

+ Timed destruction.

+ Explosions with fragment damaging factor.
